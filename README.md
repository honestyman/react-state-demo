This shoe store app showcases 8 ways to handle React state.

## Quick Start

Make sure you have these installed:

- [Node 10](http://nodejs.org) or newer (To check your version: `npm -v`)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com)

Then, run these commands on the command line:

```
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` starts the app and the mock API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
